The folder contains the data analysis for a competition organised by Kaggle to predict the passenger who can transported to other planer and visualization project using python for analysis and the summary is represented through PowerBi 

This repository contains a prediction summary and a Power BI dashboard for the spaceship Titanic. The Titanic is a fictional spaceship that is part of the science fiction world created by Douglas Adams in the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". The prediction summary is based on data from the book and is used to predict the likelihood of the Titanic crashing into a planet called Magrathea.

# Prediction Summary
The prediction summary is a detailed report that includes information about the Titanic, the data used to make the prediction, and the methodology used to make the prediction. The prediction is based on the likelihood of the Titanic crashing into a planet called Magrathea and the impact of this crash on the spaceship and its passengers.

# Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard is an interactive visual representation of the prediction summary. It includes graphs, charts, and tables that show the data used to make the prediction and the results of the prediction. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it easy for users to understand the prediction results.
